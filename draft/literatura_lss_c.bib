@article{Wang1973,
abstract = {This paper considers the problem of stabilizing a linear time-invariant multivariable system by using several local feedback control laws. Each local feedback control law depends only on partial system outputs. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of local control laws with dynamic compensation to stabilize a given system is derived. This condition is stated in terms of a new notion, called "fixed modes," which is a natural generalization of the well-known concept of uncontrollable modes and unobservable modes that occur in centralized control system problems. A procedure that constructs a set of stabilizing feedback control laws is given.},
