abstract = {Swarm systems have received increasing research attention in recent years and they can be found in many application areas as diverse as unmanned vehicle formation systems, multi-robot systems, sensor networks, etc. Reliability and safety are important issues in swarm systems, which can be improved by the fault diagnosis technology. In this paper, recent development of fault diagnosis algorithms for swarm systems is reviewed. The description of swarm systems is given, followed by characteristics of faults in swarm systems. Specially, faults in swarm systems are classified into topology faults and component faults. Then fault diagnosis algorithms for swarm systems are classified according to their architectures, fault types and approaches, respectively. Finally, several unsolved problems of fault diagnosis algorithms for swarm systems are highlighted.},

abstract = {Nonstationary signal analysis is one of the main topics in the field of machinery fault diagnosis. Time-frequency analysis can identify the signal frequency components, reveals their time variant features, and is an effective tool to extract machinery health information contained in nonstationary signals. Various time-frequency analysis methods have been proposed and applied to machinery fault diagnosis. These include linear and bilinear time-frequency representations (e.g., wavelet transform, Cohen and affine class distributions), adaptive parametric time-frequency analysis (based on atomic decomposition and time-frequency auto-regressive moving average models), adaptive non-parametric time-frequency analysis (e.g., Hilbert-Huang transform, local mean decomposition, and energy separation), and time varying higher order spectra. This paper presents a systematic review of over 20 major such methods reported in more than 100 representative articles published since 1990. Their fundamental principles, advantages and disadvantages, and applications to fault diagnosis of machinery have been examined. Some examples have also been provided to illustrate their performance. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Widodo2007,
abstract = {Recently, the issue of machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis as a part of maintenance system became global due to the potential advantages to be gained from reduced maintenance costs, improved productivity and increased machine availability. This paper presents a survey of machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis using support vector machine (SVM). It attempts to summarize and review the recent research and developments of SVM in machine condition monitoring and diagnosis. Numerous methods have been developed based on intelligent systems such as artificial neural network, fuzzy expert system, condition-based reasoning, random forest, etc. However, the use of SVM for machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis is still rare. SVM has excellent performance in generalization so it can produce high accuracy in classification for machine condition monitoring and diagnosis. Until 2006, the use of SVM in machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis is tending to develop towards expertise orientation and problem-oriented domain. Finally, the ability to continually change and obtain a novel idea for machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis using SVM will be future works.},

abstract = {Poorly maintained, degraded, and improperly controlled equipment wastes an estimated 15{\%} to 30{\%} of energy used in commercial buildings. Much of this waste could be prevented with widespread adoption of automated condition-based maintenance. Automated fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) along with prognostics provide a cornerstone for condition-based maintenance of engineered systems. Although FDD has been an active area of research in other fields for more than a decade, applications for heating, ventilating, air conditioning, and refrigeration (HVAC{\&}R) and other building systems have lagged those in other industries. Nonetheless, over the last decade there has been considerable research and development targeted toward developing FDD methods for HVAC{\&}R equipment. Despite this research, there are still only a handful of FDD tools that are deployed in the field. This paper is the first of a two-part review of methods for automated FDD and prognostics whose intent is to increase awareness of the HVAC{\&}R research and development community to the body of FDD and prognostics developments in other fields as well as advancements in the field of HVAC{\&}R. This first part of the review focuses on generic FDD and prognostics, providing a framework for categorizing methods, describing them, and identifying their primary strengths and weaknesses. The second paper in this review, to be published in the April 2005 International Journal of HVAC{\&}R Research, will address research and applications specific to the fields of HVAC{\&}R.},

@article{Nandi2005,
abstract = {Recently, research has picked up a fervent pace in the area of fault diagnosis of electrical machines. The manufacturers and users of these drives are now keen to include diagnostic fea- tures in the software to improve salability and reliability. Apart from locating specific harmonic components in the line current (popularly known as motor current signature analysis), other sig- nals, such as speed, torque, noise, vibration etc., are also explored for their frequency contents. Sometimes, altogether different tech- niques, such as thermal measurements, chemical analysis, etc., are also employed to find out the nature and the degree of the fault. In addition, human involvement in the actual fault detection decision making is slowly being replaced by automated tools, such as ex- pert systems, neural networks, fuzzy-logic-based systems; to name a few. It is indeed evident that this area is vast in scope. Hence, keeping in mind the need for future research, a review paper de- scribing different types of faults and the signatures they generate and their diagnostics' schemes will not be entirely out of place. In particular, such a review helps to avoid repetition of pastwork and gives a bird's eye view to a new researcher in this area.},
