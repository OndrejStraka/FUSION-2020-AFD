abstract = {The ability to maintain state awareness in the face of unexpected and unmodeled errors and threats is a defining feature of a resilient control system. Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem of distributed fault detection and isolation (FDI) in large networked systems with uncertain system models. The linear networked system is composed of interconnected subsystems and may be represented as a graph. The subsystems are represented by nodes, while the edges correspond to the interconnections between subsystems. Considering faults that may occur on the interconnections and subsystems, as our first contribution, we propose a distributed scheme to jointly detect and isolate faults occurring in nodes and edges of the system. As our second contribution, we analyze the behavior of the proposed scheme under model uncertainties caused by the addition or removal of edges. Additionally, we propose a novel distributed FDI scheme based on local models and measurements that is resilient to changes outside of the local subsystem and achieves FDI. Our third contribution addresses the complexity reduction of the distributed FDI method, by characterizing the minimum amount of model information and measurements needed to achieve FDI and by reducing the number of monitoring nodes. The proposed methods can be fused to design a scalable and resilient distributed FDI architecture that achieves local FDI despite unknown changes outside the local subsystem. The proposed approach is illustrated by numerical experiments on the IEEE 118-bus power network benchmark.},

abstract = {The paper deals with the problem of defining the optimal topology for a distributed fault detection architecture for non-linear large-scale systems. A stochastic modelbased framework for diagnosis is formulated. The system structural graph is decomposed into subsystems and each subsystem is monitored by one local diagnoser. It is shown that overlapping of subsystems allows to improve the detectability properties of the monitoring architecture. Based on this theoretical result, an optimal decomposition design method is proposed, able to define the minimum number of detection units needed to guarantee the detectability of certain faults while minimizing the communication costs subject to some computation cost constraints. An algorithmic procedure is presented to solve the proposed optimal decomposition problem. Preliminary simulation results show the potential of the proposed approach.},

@inproceedings{Sauter2006,
abstract = {In this paper, the fault tolerant control problem is addressed in a networked framework. An isolation filter together with a fault compensation mechanism are pro- posed for FDI/FTC. Several design procedures are studied. First, in the centralized architecture, the inputs and outputs information used for FDI {\&} FTC are collected and processed in a central node. Considering that sub-systems exchange information over the network, a decentralized architecture is then proposed for FDI/FTC. The au- tonomous capability of the decentralized design is also considered. But, whatever the design architecture is, fault detectability and isolability, are dependant on the available information. A method based on system structural analysis is then proposed,to provide fault detectability and fault isolability conditions, thus making possible fault tolerant control. Finally, we give an algorithm which allows to distribute a system into subsystems such that the problem of autonomous FDI is solvable for each of these subsystems.},

A particular design of sliding mode observer is presented for which the parameters can be obtained using LMI techniques. A fault estimation approach is presented to estimate the fault and the estimation error is dependent on the bounds on the uncertainty. For a special class of uncertainty, a fault reconstruction scheme is presented where the reconstructed signal can approximate the fault signal to any accuracy. The proposed fault estimation/reconstruction signals are only based on the available plant input/ouput information and can be calculated on-line. Finally, a simulation study on a robotic arm system is presented to show the effectiveness of the scheme.},
